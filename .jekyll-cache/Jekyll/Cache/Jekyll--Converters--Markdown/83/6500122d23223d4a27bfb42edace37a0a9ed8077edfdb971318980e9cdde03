The Yan laboratory in the Shanghai Institute of Immunity and Infection of Chinese Academy of Sciences is looking 
to hire <a href="#postdoc">postdoctoral research fellow</a> and <a href="#research-technicians">research assistants</a>. Tell your friends / Retweet!</p>

<p><strong>Overall responsibility</strong>
The successful candidate will work with Dr. Yan Yan on incorporating mining from multi-omics data into population studies 
to understand the role of the gut microbiome in human cancers, in Chinese Academy of Sciences (CMDH webpage 
<a href="http://sourcedb.shanghaipasteur.cas.cn/yw/Talent2016/PI2016/202207/t20220701_6469287.html" target="_blank">link</a>). Our 
primary aim is to discover and validate new bioactives from the human gut microbiome that related to oncogenesis and 
therapeutic resistance, which will accelerate innovation of preventive and therapeutic approaches. We currently focus 
on population-scale analysis of detailed microbiome multiâ€™omics profiles (metagenomes, metatranscriptomes, metabolomes, etc.) 
to prioritize species, strains, microbial gene products, and small molecule metabolites with novel human metabolic or 
immunomodulatory activities. He or she will be responsible for biostatistical methods development for microbiome quantitative, 
metagenomic, and multi-omic data on the project, and interpret the microbiome data in the view of ecological and evolutionary, 
with a particular focus on bacteria and non-bacterial (e.g. viral, eukaryotic) members of the human gut microbiome.</p>
