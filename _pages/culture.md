## Focus on training

Science is challenge and our research team values work creativity and scientific curiosity. I schedule weekly one-on-one meetings with all lab members to provide regular feedback on research progression and experimental results. We also have small group with common research themes biweekly to discuss common technique questions. To show our own character during pandemic, our research team switch to work remotely by organizing focus-section virtually, in this way, we can work together and conquer hard time. In these meetings, we focus on improve our critical thinking, work together to troubleshoot problems, and hope to continue strive for better ourselves.

## Weekly group meeting

We start lab meeting with announcements, including celebrating personal milestones, and lab business.  Each team member is encouraged to give a 1 minute ‘elevator pitch’ filling in the lab about their research progress during past week. Our research talk is presented by one speaker with about 15 slides, followed by 1 hour journal club presented by one speaker. The goal is to get feedback about ongoing projects, and get inspiration from peer reviews, and share the recent cool paper that inspired you.
