<p>Yanâ€™s lab has committed to taking the challenge of understanding how gut microbes may contribute to disease initiation 
and progression and using this understanding to change the way that we diagnose and treat patients, particularly extreme 
cases in patients with colorectal cancer and lung cancer. To defect this deadly disease, we need to better understand 
every aspect of its causes: what are the risk factors, and how does it form and spread. We also need to uncover the link 
between the characteristics of tumor microenvironment and the different ways in patientsâ€™ response to treatment. Our research 
projects have three broad objectives:</p>

<p>We are integrating metagenome profiling with machine learning approaches to unveil the influence of lifestyle and 
environmental factors on the microbiome in large scale investigations of human populations. We expect to have far-reaching 
implications in the field of hypothesis-driven microbiome discovery, forward from the correlative studies based on large-scale 
population cohorts. The gut microbiome has been linked to CRC, but the causal alterations that may precede CRC have not been 
clearly elucidated. In one of our previous works, I led the analysis and assessed microbiome changes prior to colorectal neoplasia 
and determined potential causality of early microbial changes in CRC. This study demonstrates the feasibility of monitoring Lynch 
patients using non-invasive, microbiome-focused methods and to disaggregate early-stage, potentially causal changes associated with 
the development of neoplasia from microbiome responses that correlate with CRC and its associated treatment.</p>

<p>The biological importance and varied metabolic capabilities of specific microbial strains has long been established. We already 
know how pathogenic strain variants are detrimental to human health, but the disease consequences of more subtle genetic 
variation in the microbiome have only recently been exposed. Our lab has several collaborations with Shanghai medical teams 
and study the role of microbial strains during cancer immunotherapy. We are developing computational algorithm and statistical 
modeling to investigate how the tumor microbiome influence the impact of or shaped in cancer patients receiving novel cancer 
therapy. These will provide multiple opportunities for potential translation into the clinic through the development of novel 
diagnostics and therapeutics that target microbes to improve cancer treatment efficacy, and ultimately facilitate the personalized 
medicine in public health.</p>

<p>Loss of biodiversity can have significant consequences for ecosystem processes. However, the relative contribution of host 
characteristics to the process of microbial community assembly at different functional levels is not yet known, such as tumor 
microenvironment. We are developing experimental approach such as Dilution-seq and PMA-seq methodology to achieve different 
levels of complexity of possible microbial inoculum to study the role of diversity and activity in community assembly and 
environmental filtering of bacterial community assembly. We also combine experimental approaches for direct visualization 
of host-microbe interactions in the tumor microenvironment and functional validation in vivo model systems.</p>
